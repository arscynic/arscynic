      “The large rooms of which you are so proud are in fact your shame. They are big enough to hold crowds—and also big enough to shut out the voice of the poor.... There is your sister or brother, naked, crying! And you stand confused over the choice of an attractive floor covering.” —Ambrose, fourth century.

    <blockquote><p>
      “What keeps you from giving now? Isn't the poor person there? Aren't your own warehouses full? Isn't the reward promised? The command is clear: the hungry person is dying now, the naked person is freezing now, the person in debt is beaten now-and you want to wait until tomorrow? "I'm not doing any harm," you say. "I just want to keep what I own, that's all." You own! You are like someone who sits down in a theater and keeps everyone else away, saying that what is there for everyone's use is your own...If everyone took only what they needed and gave the rest to those in need, there would be no such thing as rich and poor. After all, didn't you come into life naked, and won't you return naked to the earth? The bread in your cupboard belongs to the hungry person; the coat hanging unused in your closet belongs to the person who needs it; the shoes rotting in your closet belong to the person with no shoes; the money which you put in the bank belongs to the poor. You do wrong to everyone you could help, but fail to help.” —Basil, fourth century.

    <p>I've been paid the incorrect amount for three times in two months now. Today I emailed them about the last mistake, and they called back saying:</p>

    <blockquote><p>"There's nothing we can do. What's on the contract was a mistake."</p></blockquote>

    <p>About one hour later they called back:</p>

    <p>The world has become a parody of itself; characterized by excessive speculation but moral bankruptcy. Societies that revere the rich and famous before the frugal and wise are on a fast-track toward demise. Admire virtue, not vanity.</p>

    <p>It seems that due to corona lockdowns humanity has been put on a fast-track to collectively losing their minds. Finance already had way too big of an influence on the workings of society, and this effect has been put into overdrive. Scrutiny is out the window, scam or not, as long as there's potential profit. Now imagine a society that purely consists of speculators and influencers, producing nothing of value. It seems we're going that way; a societal mix of Wall-E and Idiocracy, addicted to entertainment and money. Those people will think they're free, but will in fact be entirely dependent on countries that produce nearly everything in the world.</p>

    <p>I'm not going to mention any country because I believe in a Cosmopolitan future, so I don't care who it is. However, before we get to such a place, it seems it will be preceded by significant turbulence. Pardon my perhaps unsubstantiated or hyperbolic claims, but that's what I'm seeing at the moment.</p>

			<p>Does anyone ever discuss the future they want to see anymore?</p>
      <p>I honestly think the vast majority of humanity needs to revert back. We don't NEED any of this BS. Especially in America. Personal cars, new clothes every season, Keurigs, juicers, new appliances every 5 years... it's a mess.</p>
      <p>But at the same time I don't want new technology to die out. It needs to move forward where it actually matters: in transportation, space travel, efficiency...</p>
      <p>The entire nation can't technologically progress at the same rate as technology is invented. It needs to be self-sufficient. It needs to be understandable and maintainable. for the vast majority, it needs to be somewhat stagnant.</p>
      <p>The traditional appliance didn't need any improvement after 1970. Sure, we can make them mechanically more efficient, but it's unnecessary to give them touch screens and computers...</p>

    <p>Being against planned obsolescence is the opposite of being a Luddite.</p>
    <p>I wholeheartedly agree with you. I think it's absurd to own a car (or anything) if it just sits there probably north of ninety percent of its lifetime. And it makes the urban environment dangerous and aesthetically extremely unpleasant. Cars are just a means of transportation, that's it. The status symbol that comes with it should be ridiculed, just like Elon Muskuito and all the other corrupted multimillionaires who manipulate the populace through marketing and advertising into wanting the things they're selling. Yes, I realise people have to travel to work, but that's another thing that we could do less of. The normalization of dedicating one's life to work, and not one's family or tight-knit community of friends and neighbours. I mean seriously, isn't it ridiculous that people spend more time with their co-workers rather than friends and family?</p>
    <p>Anyway, all of this needs extensive nuance and tons of tangents. But it's good to get the ball rolling. We earthlings must do better; especially we privileged greedy Westerners.</p>

			<p>Plenty of things are unused most of the time. A house or apartment is empty the majority of each day. Cars, public roads, public transit, etc are never utilized even close to 100%. Certain roads in America are utilized to less than 10% of maximum capacity regularly. Even major highways are optimized for rush hour so the majority of the time the are not fully utilized. Bike lanes in most places are nearly empty the majority of the day.</p>
      <p>Every pair of clothing you own is in the closet 90+% of the time rather than being worn. If you own a bicycle it’s going to be parked over 90% of the time too unless bicycling is part of your job.</p>
      <p>Good luck getting any sort of ride share working on a large scale as the time you’re going to be using your car is the time someone else probably wants to use the car too.</p>

    <p><span class="inline-quote">“A house or apartment is empty the majority of each day.”</span><br>Yes, and I've got a problem with that too. Why work so much to pay off a house you're not going to spend the majority of your time in? Not that I'm against owning a home—this topic requires much nuance—I'm merely pointing out a flaw in our current system. Owning X or Y is sensible for some, but not everyone. But thanks to marketing, advertising, archaic traditions, or peer pressure, people who could absolutely do without are being ostracized and almost coerced into the rat race. No wonder Western society is popping pills like no other.</p>
    <p><span class="inline-quote">“Every pair of clothing you own is in the closet 90+%”</span><br>That's why I rarely buy clothes.</p>
    <p><span class="inline-quote">“bicycle it’s going to be parked over 90%”</span><br>Bicycles are cheap, they don't pollute, they're silent, you can put them inside your home, they're good for your health, they're far less of a death sentence in a collision, and they're not visually disturbing as cars unless there aren't enough bicycle racks.</p>

    <p>Don't touch crypto“currencies” for they are a mix of pyramid schemes and ponzi schemes rife with fraud, scams, and prices that are artificially inflated with other imaginary tokens. The only thing it does is incentivize greed and increase the wealth inequality even more.</p>

    <blockquote>
			<p>“Any new “currency” or speculative digital token that doesn't have a fair distribution mechanism is a multi-level marketing pyramid scheme by default. Hence, not a currency. The earliest adopters of such flawed contrivances will always have an increasingly disproportionate amount of the total wealth as it gets adopted. Early adopters mine or buy large proportions of the total supply at negligible costs while late adopters mine or buy negligible proportions at large costs. It follows that holders immediately have every incentive to get as many people to buy after them.”</p>

    <p>Nice propaganda, but that's all it is.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First of all, I don't see any USD laser eyed cultists trying to sell me their coin. Moreover, inflation does not mean it's a pyramid scheme, and neither does the Cantillon effect. Last Week Tonight with John Oliver just recently did an episode on debt: <a href="https://youtu.be/yq_E3HquRJY">https://youtu.be/yq_E3HquRJY</a>.</li>
      <li>Second, ad hominem.</li>
      <li>Third, financial demagoguery; scaring people into thinking this is the last chance or everything will be awful from now on. Guess what, even if everything goes into a digital coin, things of actual value will still need to be produced. People will still be able to survive and thrive as they see fit. What the world needs is to tax the rich, not a new currency that enriches the rich even more.</li>
      <li>Fourth, it is unlikely that countries are going to adopt any of the current crypto pyramid schemes. Why? Let's say country A has 80% of scamcoin. If a rivalling country B had 0%, but wanted to buy into scamcoin, it would be making country A wealthier. Not going to happen. In fact, I think the opposite is happening. The countries who are currently mining the most are effectively siphoning wealth from the USA. E.g., China loves nothing more than to sell their bitcons to US citizens. More actual wealth for them, and I can't blame them.</li>

    <p>Wise and rich is an oxymoron. Smart and rich is not. Those who are both wise and smart won't be rich because they realise it is immoral to hoard wealth when there is still so much wealth inequality that's causing needless suffering.

    <p>To me, this whole cryptocurrency nonsense is a symptom of a collapsing society. The rampant greed is beyond comprehension. United we stand, divided we fall.

			<p>“Tulip mania reached its peak during the winter of 1636–37, when some bulb contracts were reportedly changing hands ten times in a day. No deliveries were ever made to fulfill any of these contracts, because in February 1637, tulip bulb contract prices collapsed abruptly and the trade of tulips ground to a halt. The collapse began in Haarlem, when, for the first time, buyers apparently refused to show up at a routine bulb auction. This may have been because Haarlem was then suffering from an outbreak of bubonic plague. The existence of the plague may have helped to create a culture of fatalistic risk-taking that allowed the speculation to skyrocket in the first place; this outbreak might also have helped to burst the bubble.” —Wikipedia</p>

My experience with crypto“currencies” has been one of the most soul rotting periods of my life, for its rise can be explained purely by greed. Therefore, I consider it important enough to be openly critical about it, but I also don't want to lose too much time on it as it is a profoundly uninspiring topic surrounded by a toxic cult “community”.</p>

			<p>I think you're hitting some of the key points, but I'll a few of my thoughts on the topic.</p>
      <p>Part of the problem with collapse as an ideology is that it's hard to advocate for a course of action. Cryptocurrency and techno utopianism allow people to take part in several of mankind's toxic past times at once: gambling and fraud. What's worse is that along the way they are framing it as a narrative of progress.</p>
      <p>One of the things that I think the collapse community really needs to do is find a way to encourage a different kind of thinking, and at the core of it there needs to be actionable beliefs that are a clear contrast to the toxic behaviors that are prevalent in our current societies.</p>
      <p>What's funny is that in one of your responses you sort of imply the same thing: If cryptocurrency is a scam, the stock market and speculative options are a scam, modern business practices are an anti-ethical scam, then we must be able to actually propose an alternative or people will just keep cycling through scams...</p>

There's no point in a revolution if one wouldn't know what to do once revolution is achieved. This is why most revolutions fail. Anyway, personally I can get behind ideas such as resource based economies (The Venus Project), circular economies, ecomodernism, cybersocialism (“economic planning is now feasible due to availablity of vast computational power”, I'm sceptical but it's interesting to study), localism, degrowth, etc.</p>

It's a cliché, but true. You'll change more people's minds by example than by argument (which I'm planning in my upcoming blog post).</p>
    <p>Pardon my comment being all over the place, it all requires tons of nuance, but I'm dying to go outside. Anyway, I'm curious about your take on the matter. TTYL.</p>

    <p>Edit: on second thought, a caveat. I don't think cryptocurrencies should never exist; just not in the form of pyramid schemes as they are now. In what form should they exist then? Well, having a distribution mechanism without a profit motive. An example: <a href="https://www.delta.tudelft.nl/article/delft-cafe-premieres-eemcs-blockchain-euro">https://www.delta.tudelft.nl/article/delft-cafe-premieres-eemcs-blockchain-euro</a>, (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26409174">HackerNews thread</a>). Whether blockchain is at all necessary is another subject though. But I'm not writing it off completely. What I am writing off is all currencies where the first adopters who take the least risk while attaining the greatest proportion of total supply are rewarded the most.</p>

			<p>Actually the first adopters take a significant risk, since they invest in something new, untested and potentially exploitable. After an altcoin is battle tested for a significant period then some of the risks associated with being one of the first buyers go down, while the risks associated with buying a more expensive coin that might go down grow. It's somewhat balanced imo.</p>

    <p><strong>CynicusRex</strong>, 6 points:</p>
    <p>False. The developers and first adopters assume little to no risk because they can easily mine or buy a significant portion of the total supply at a negligible cost. The higher the price of the pyramid scheme, the more risk you're taking because you're paying a lot more for a lot less of the total supply.</p>

      <p>And baghold it forever if it's not a good coin. With any new thing it's more of a gamble and it can go either way. That's why if you want to invest it's better to invest in tested and proven coins instead of gambling on random new ones.</p>
		</blockquote>

    <p><strong>CynicusRex</strong>, 3 points:</p>
    <p>If you create a coin out of thin air you're not bagholding anything because you haven't invested anything. So, the developers assume no risk. As for early investors, I'm not going to repeat myself. Moreover, currencies are not meant to appreciate or depreciate quickly, they should only facilitate trade. Therefore, investing in currencies is a misnomer; it either isn't investing or it isn't a currency.</p>

    <p>Doesn't matter what the price does if you can just mine them with a run-of-the-mill CPU, or if you can buy a significant percentage with a trivial amount of fiat. Big upside, small downside.

TCP/IP quickly had practical and legitimate use-cases which steadily took off. The longer it existed, the more the answer tends toward “worse off” since so much was getting built on it. Fast-forward to today, humanity would definitely be worse off if TCP/IP vanished, despite social media being harmful. Just think about the logistic chaos it would cause.</p>
    <p>As for bitcoin, the converse is true. In the beginning it seemed benign—not a full-on pyramid scheme yet since every participant could mine on their PCs. Which could've grown into a fair digital token provided some tweaks toward a fair distribution mechanism. However, as time went on it became a greed inducing, energy wasting pyramid scheme with speculation as its predominant use-case. Same goes for every other cryptocurrency.</p>

    <blockquote>
			<p><span class="inline-quote">“Why is radioactive decay a random process?”</span><br>Unfortunately there's not really much of a meaningful answer which can be given here. It's random because the most statistically accurate description happens to be random, and no determining factors have been found to date. Quantum mechanics — the most accurate theory of small phenomena such as particle decay — is a fundamentally probabilistic theory; it can tell us what all of the probabilities are for any process to occur within a given time frame but it can't tell us exactly when any specific process will occur.</p>
      <p>Most interpretations of quantum mechanics simply assert that the randomness in the theory is inherent to nature, and that's that. There are some interpretations which retain full determinism, but this necessarily comes at the cost of other important and nice features such as locality (i.e. no faster-than-light signalling and no causality violations). There is an important theorem known as Bell's theorem which essentially says that a classical theory (one with all of the "nice" features like locality and determinism) cannot ever reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics, and experiments have repeatedly shown that nature favors quantum mechanics' predictions over classical predictions. Consequently, at least one "nice" feature such as determinism or locality must be violated in nature ... but unfortunately Bell's theorem does not give us a way to ascertain exactly which feature is the wrong one. That's essentially what the different interpretations of quantum mechanics are about: different interpretations reject different features, and then explore what those decisions mean for how nature must behave. But we don't know which interpretation is actually correct.</p>
      <p><span class="inline-quote">“Subsequently, why isn't “random” a euphemism for “we don't understand the cause yet”?”</span><br>Because a truly random variable is <del>uncaused</del> undetermined by definition.</p>
      <p>(Edit: wording adjustment because random processes are not necessarily uncaused even if they are undetermined; there are processes where some causing factor might require one of them to necessarily happen — for example, to conserve energy or momentum — but which one actually does happen is still randomly chosen from a probability distribution over the possible outcomes.)</p>
      <p>The key thing to understand, in my opinion, is that a pseudorandom process (i.e. one which is actually deterministic but for which the determining factors are unknown or known but practically impossible to control) and a truly random process (i.e. one with no determining factors at all) can both produce a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_randomness">statistically random</a> dataset. Consequently it is impossible in practice to determine whether a given random variable in nature is truly random or merely pseudorandom.</p>
      <p><span class="inline-quote">“What prevents us from ever being able to predict the radioactive decay of an atom, regardless of technological progress?”</span></p>
      <p>It may simply be the case that there is no governing principle by which such a prediction could ever be made. If there are simply no determining factors, then that's kind of all she wrote.</p>
      <p>Hope that helps,</p>

      <p>It's important to keep in mind that all interpretations - as different as they are - make things appear random to observers in the universe. None of the interpretations allow the prediction of unique observed outcomes for some experiments. It's either truly random, it must appear random within all knowledge you can gain within the universe, or all possible outcomes will be observed "somewhere".</p>

			<p>Yes, that's true and a good point. Even interpretations which retain full determinism do not allow us to actually make predictions not based on probabilities. :(</p>
      <p>I am not sure I see how "which interpretation is correct" wouldn't be a meaningful question though, in spite of the above. Since interpretations take different stances on the ontology of nature, in a sense telling us "how nature behaves," even if knowing that ontology does not help us in terms of experiments or observations I do still think there is meaning and value in knowing from a philosophy of science standpoint.</p>

The most character building period in my life was the first year of digital art and game development college. When you drew something that was shit, they told you it was shit and why, for the whole class. Without shaming the person of course, the criticism was purely objective. The majority of people desperately need to experience that; constructive criticism is what makes you better at what you do. Not being able to acknowledge one's own mistakes is what's making the world worse at the moment, everybody wants to be right, safe, be a snowflake, etc. But I'm getting way off-topic here.</p>
    <p>The reasons for not being optimized for mobile are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I want it to be optimized for mobile without specifically being optimized for mobile. It needs to be usable on every device by default, with the same code. I also want it to be super lightweight so it barely uses power and loads quickly.
        (I hate the current state of most websites: you need to click too damn much, it takes too much time to find stuff, ads and trackers everywhere, and scripts are used indiscriminately as if CPU power is unlimited. If you use an adblocker like uBlock Origin, you can notice there's not a trace of ads, trackers, and not even Google Analytics which nearly every website uses).</li>
      <li>People need to spend a lot less time on their mobile devices anyway; they're addicted enough already.</li>
      <li>It takes too much time to optimize for every resolution, or research frameworks that do it for you, etc. I don't want to rely on third parties. I hate it that Web development changes so fast that what you learn one year, is outdated in the next. I prefer to learn things like math, knowledge that can be used always.</li>

    <p>I'll contemplate about what I could change to make it more mobile friendly, while still keeping all the information on a single page. I highly appreciate you having taken the time to write feedback and take a screenshot, thank you! I'm all ears if you have suggestions.</p>

      <p>Like she'll keep poking at private questions like "so you and X are dating now", and she won't drop it until the celeb basically confesses.</p>
      <p>One of the worst I heard about was when she basically forced a celeb to come clean about being pregnant. Think it was Mariah Carey? She later suffered a miscarriage and had to tell the public since Ellen outed her pregnancy :/</p>

    <p>Ik had enigszins graag bij de politie gewerkt. Aan m'n 19e deelgenomen aan de ingangsexamens, maar faalde voor de selectiecommissie, terecht.</p>
    <p>Tien jaar later nog eens meegedaan, maar bewust het proces gestopt omdat de job volgens mij voornamelijk neerkomt op het oplossen van door idioten veroorzaakte problemen. Ik heb daar vermoedelijk geen geduld meer voor, en ik wil mijn fysieke en mentale gezondheid niet opofferen. Daarbovenop kan ik me niet neerleggen bij het opvolgen van onterechte bevelen of orders gebaseerd op onlogische, archaïsche, of contraproductieve wetten. [Indien dit wordt gelezen door personeel bij de politie, corrigeer mij indien ik volledig verkeerd ben.]</p>
    <p>De politie is als antibiotica: levensnoodzakelijk, maar te veel overbodig voorgeschreven, met als gevolg zowel frustraties bij de politie als bij het volk. Wie wint er in deze situatie? De echte criminelen, de resistente bacteriën.</p>

    <p>M'n eerste LSD trip behoort tot de beste dagen in m'n leven. In totaal zo'n vijf keer gedaan in een periode van vier jaar.</p>

    <p><strong>The bad:</strong></p>
    <p>-Tijdens m'n derde ervaring op het einde van z'n werking een bad trip gehad van zo'n twee uur, na het bekijken van Rick & Morty; Ik was overtuigd dat het leven een spel was waarin moedwillig zelfmoord plegen de enige manier was om over te gaan naar het volgende level.</p>
    <p>-Na een andere trip, toen ik ging slapen, werd ik plots wakker en zag ik vanuit m'n ooghoeken een gestalte staan. Ik probeerde op te staan, maar kon niet bewegen. Dat was één van de engste tien seconden in m'n leven. (Dit heet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis</a>, en is niet persé geassocieerd of veroorzaakt door LSD.)</p>

    <p><strong>The good:</strong></p>
    <p>+Je ervaart een onbeschrijfelijke connectie met de realiteit of het universum. Je snapt dingen; dingen die in een gewone staat ook te vatten zijn, maar waarbij we niet stilstaan.</p>
    <p>+Liefde.</p>
    <p>+Geen kater. Meer nog, na m'n eerste trip was ik een week lang in een staat van heldere opgetogenheid, bijna euforisch, zonder achteraf in een somber gat te vallen—dat laatste was wel vaak het geval toen ik nog alcohol dronk.</p>
    <p>+Niet toxisch.</p>
    <p>+In tegenstelling tot dronkenschap dat een kortstondig vals gevoel van voldoening geeft, en dat u dingen laat doen of zeggen dat niet gealigneerd zijn met wie je echt ben, geeft LSD een langwerkende toename van wijsheid (hoe pretentieus dat ook klinkt), zelf-kennis, verbondenheid, mindfulness, etc.</p>

    <p><strong>Advies:</strong></p>
    <p>+Doe het niet uit groepsdruk, zoals bij elke drug. (Ik ben overtuigd dat meer dan 80% van de bevolking geen alcohol zou drinken indien ze niet van jongs af aan daartoe aangespoord werden. Bijvoorbeeld de uitspraak "Je zult het leren drinken." vind ik primitief, dom, en walgelijk.)</p>
    <p>Wat mijn interesse voor LSD heeft aangewakkerd was een documentaire waarin een wiskundige een gelijkaardige psychedelica nam waardoor hij tijdens z'n trip in een soort wiskundig universum zat. Aangezien ik zonder LSD, als kind, al eens droomde dat ik een piramide-blok was in een 3D fractale geometrisch constructie dat zichzelf constant afbrak en opbouwde, wilde ik nogmaals zo iets ervaren.</p>
    <p>+Doe het in een omgeving waar je op uw gemak bent, of met iemand die je volledig vertrouwt. Mijn eerste keer was met een vrouw dat ik volledig vertrouwde. Een andere keer was met een man, en toen was het minder aangenaam aangezien hij zijn ego (masker) niet volledig kon laten vallen. Dus, m'n voorkeur: met vrouw > alleen > met man.</p>
    <p>+Informeer uzelf.</p>

    <p>Om eerlijk te zijn, ik beschouw België als een land van alcoholiekers. De hoedanigheid en manier van alcoholconsumptie dat door de maatschappij als normaal wordt beschouwd is absurd. Zoals ouders die op alle andere vlakken verstandig zijn, het gangbaar vinden dat hun kinderen regelmatig dronken gaan. Ikzelf was 17 toen ik m'n eerste pint dronk (nu al 426 dagen nuchter), maar sommige kennissen waren 14 of 15, en die ouders vonden dat OK.</p>
    <p>Elk weekend doen zovelen hetzelfde, op café gaan. Telkens hetzelfde verhaal. Ik denk dat Belgen diep vanbinnen ongelukkig en overwerkt zijn, en het routinematig alcoholgebruik hun daarvan verdoofd.</p>

    <p>PS Ik heb niets tegen alcohol, alles heeft zijn plaats. Maar overtollig gebruik geeft een vals gevoel van voldoening. Voldoening die we beter halen uit niet drank en eten gerelateerde activiteiten.</p>

			<p>Alcohol can be consumed, of course, but getting smashed every weekend is beyond me. What's wrong with one or two beers on an evening instead of 10-15? Why do you do that...?</p>

			<p>Shopping isn't a hobby. Learn to enjoy redecorating with the things you already own instead of buying new things all the time. It's not sustainable to buy and donate things on a regular basis. It creates a stream of unwanted stuff that most likely will end up in landfill.</p>

    <p><span class="inline-quote">“Shopping isn't a hobby.”</span><br>Exactly. You're missing something in life; you're filling that void with shopping. Learn a skill instead. Perhaps you could learn to draw and sketch all the decorations you have in mind. Or learn how to weave intricate designs with just ropes and knots; when you're bored with the weave, undo the knots and create something different. No money and resources wasted.</p>
    <p>Lastly, watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exL51n3py6g">Fight Club</a> Ikea scene.</p>
